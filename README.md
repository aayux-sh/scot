Description
"Scott" is a sleek, user-friendly product catalog website where authors can showcase products with names, descriptions, and direct links for users to explore and purchase. Designed with a modern blue-and-white theme, it features responsive product cards, hover effects, and a comprehensive footer inspired by e-commerce sites like Flipkart. Visitors can browse curated items, read details, and click links to external sites (e.g., Amazon). The site emphasizes simplicity, trust, and engagement, with social media integration (including your Instagram @techby.eren) for community building. Ideal for affiliate marketing or product recommendations, it's fully static, loads quickly, and works on all devices.

This repository contains the source code for the website, built using pure HTML and CSS for easy deployment on GitHub Pages. No backend or databases are required, making it lightweight and cost-free to host.

Deployment
Prerequisites: A free GitHub account (sign up at github.com if needed).
Create Repository:
Name it scott (or yourusername.github.io for a root domain).
Make it public.
Initialize with a README (optional, as this file can be added later).
Upload Code:
Copy the full HTML code (from the previous response) into a file named index.html.
Upload index.html to your repository (via GitHub's web interface or Git).
Enable GitHub Pages:
Go to the repository's Settings tab.
Scroll to the "Pages" section.
Select "Deploy from a branch" and choose the main (or master) branch.
Click Save. The site will be live in 1-2 minutes at https://yourusername.github.io/scott.
Updates: Edit index.html directly in GitHub, commit changes, and the site updates automatically.
Custom Domain (Optional): Buy a domain (e.g., scott.com) and link it in the Pages settings for a professional URL.
Pros: Free, no server needed. Cons: Manual updates for new products.

Usage
For Authors: Add products by editing the HTML code. Each product is a <div class="product"> block with image, title, description, and link. Replace placeholders (e.g., image URLs, product details) with real data.
For Users: Visit the live site, browse products, read descriptions, and click links to check/purchase items on external platforms.
Customization Tips:
Change colors: Edit hex codes in the <style> section (e.g., #007BFF for blue).
Add Products: Duplicate product divs and update content.
Images: Use HTTPS URLs (e.g., from Imgur or your own host) to avoid loading issues.
Testing: Preview locally with a browser or use GitHub's preview feature.
